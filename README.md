Submissions for Algorithms I-II courses of Princeton University at coursera.org

### [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
>- [X] [Week 1 - Percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)
>- Write a program to estimate the value of the *percolation threshold* via Monte Carlo simulation.

>- [X] [Week 2 - Deques and Randomized Queues](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html)
>- Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue.
>- The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

>- [X] [Week 3 - Pattern Recognition](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html)
>- Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

>- [ ] [Week 4 - 8 Puzzle](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html)
>- Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
